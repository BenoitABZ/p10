I'am an OC student finishing his seventh project.

Follow this instruction to deploy this library management application. 

Spring boot allow us to create jar files with embedded tomcat server!

To deploy:

java -jar ClientUi-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar running on port 8081

java -jar LibraryBatch-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar running on port 8080

java -jar LibraryRestApi-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar running on port 8082

To change TCP port, fork the project and modify port serie from application.properties file for each microservice

You can put these instructions into sh file, easier to execute!

Enjoy!
